## About Me:
I am a skilled data analyst with a passion for finding the story behind the numbers and extracting insights to make data-driven decisions. With a background in logistics and warehouse management, I enrolled in the Google Career Certificate: Data Analytics program to pivot my career path and start my journey in data. Upon earning this professional certificate I gained invaluable experience in data cleaning and processing tools like sheets, SQL, and R. I am also expanding my toolset to include Python.

As a data analyst, I am passionate about uncovering the deeper connection that lies in data. Using the narrative of numbers to make informed business decisions and create exciting visuals are two areas that I look forward to exploring in the data analytics field.

Among my skills as a data analyst, I am comfortable collecting reliable data that is unbiased, current, and comprehensive. Through cleaning and exploration, this data can be prepared for analysis and visualization through SQL, R, Python, and Tableau to create various plots, graphs, and visuals that can be shared with stakeholders.
